\chapter{Large Language Models}\label{ch:techOverview}

Creating machines with human-like language understanding has been a subject of research since the 1950s.
\gls{natural-language}s are highly complex and pose a difficult challenge to computers.
\gls{lm} is an approach to make machines read, write and communicate like humans~\autocite{zhao2023survey}.

The main idea of \gls{lm} is to estimate probability distributions over units of texts, e.g.\ words~\autocite{de2015survey}.
Assuming that the occurrence of a word depends on previous words, i.e.\ the context, the probability of that word being next in a sentence can be modeled with a conditional probability~\autocite{jozefowicz2016exploring}.
\[
    P(w_n | w_1, \dots , w_{n-1})
\]

The ability to estimate the probability distributions over words makes it possible to predict the next word for a given sequence.
In this way, language models can be applied in many \gls{nlp} tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, text summarization~\autocite{jozefowicz2016exploring}.
% How would translation look like?

There are different techniques to model those probability distributions.
In the 1990s, statistical language models found widespread use.

Recent research has focused on neural language models.

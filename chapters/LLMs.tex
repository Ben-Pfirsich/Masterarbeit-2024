\chapter{Large Language Models}\label{ch:techOverview}

Creating machines with human-like language understanding has been a subject of research since the 1950s.
\gls{natural-language}s are highly complex and pose a difficult challenge to computers.
\gls{lm} is an approach to make machines read, write and communicate like humans~\autocite{zhao2023survey}.

The main idea of \gls{lm} is to estimate probability distributions over units of texts, e.g.\ words~\autocite{de2015survey}.
Assuming that the occurrence of a word depends on previous words, i.e.\ the context, the probability of that word being next in a sentence can be modeled with a conditional probability~\autocite{jozefowicz2016exploring}.
\[
    P(w_n | w_1, \dots , w_{n-1})
\]

The ability to estimate the probability distributions of such language units makes it possible to predict the next words for a given sequence.



\section{notes}
language modeling approach: text as a sequence of words -> model generative likelihood
-> predict probability of next tokens

popular in the 1990s: statistical language models


from~\autocite{jozefowicz2016exploring}:
language modeling has found use in many \gls{nlp} tasks
speech recognition, machine translation, text summarization

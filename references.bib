For that purpose, we investigate the use of source labels and pretraining on standard German, allowing us to simplify standard language to a specific CEFR level. We show that these approaches are especially effective in low-resource scenarios, where we are able to outperform a standard transformer baseline. Moreover, we introduce copy labels, which we show can help the model make a distinction between sentences that require further modifications and sentences that can be copied as-is.",

Text forms an integral part of exchanging information and interacting with the world, correlating with quality and experience of life. Text complexity is one of the factors which affects a reader{'}s understanding of a text. The mapping of a body of text to a mathematical unit quantifying the degree of readability is the basis of complexity assessment. As readability might be influenced by representation, we only target the text complexity for readers in this task. We designed the task as text regression in which participants developed models to predict complexity of pieces of text for a German learner in a range from 1 to 7. The shared task is organized in two phases; the development and the test phases. Among 24 participants who registered for the shared task, ten teams submitted their results on the test data.",

These methods are limited by the quality and quantity of manually simplified corpora, which are expensive to build. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth adaptation of statistical machine translation to perform text simplification, taking advantage of large-scale paraphrases learned from bilingual texts and a small amount of manual simplifications with multiple references. Our work is the first to design automatic metrics that are effective for tuning and evaluating simplification systems, which will facilitate iterative development for this task.",
